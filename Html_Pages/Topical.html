                    <p>Because of our study within computer technology, we are dependent on the internet and not only us within this study, 
                        but according to data report there are a total of 5.30 billion people on the globe 
                        who use the internet and with 2% this number is getting bigger and bigger every year. 
                        Thus, by using satellite internet, the internet will be available to countries that 
                        today do not have access, which is very important if you want to have easy communication 
                        across other countries.

                                Slow network - Satellite signals take longer because they have to travel to space before returning to Earth. 
                                This extra travel time makes the internet via satellite feel slower. It can be particularly noticeable when you use services such as video conferencing or 
                                online games that require a quick response.

                                Satellites have ushered in a new era of secure and efficient online communication. By bouncing signals off satellites, data can be encrypted and transmitted worldwide securely, 
                                minimizing the risk of interference or tampering.

                                Satellite technology has further facilitated the development of cloud computing, allowing data to be securely stored in the cloud and accessed from any internet-connected device. 
                                This has also revolutionized the way businesses and individuals manage and share data, fostering greater global connectivity and collaboration

                                Technologies like Starlink can provide more freedom to users in countries that want to challenge censorship and restrictions, 
                                helping them circumvent strict censorship practices in China, for example.

                                Energy consumption is a major sustainability issue; satellite internet connections and equipment require large amounts of energy to operate, and this can be costly and have environmental impacts. 
                            </li>
                        </p>
                        <li>The satellites themselves require a lot of energy to operate and the launch process also uses large amounts of fuel. This fuel releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and contributes to global warming. </li>
                        <li>The researchers found that the installation of satellite internet infrastructure had a significant impact on the local ecosystem. The presence of towers and other equipment not only increased the presence of non-native species such as birds, but also caused changes in the behavior of existing species. <a href="https://ts2.space/tr/uydu-internetin-cevresel-etkisi-ve-surdurulebilirlik-zorluklari/ ">​(Frąckiewicz, 2023)​</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Make up your mind! </li>
                    <p>Better internet access: Satellite internet can make the internet available in areas where there was previously poor or no access. This helps people who live outside cities, for example those who live on a farm, gain access to information, education and job opportunities. 
 

                        Emergencies: Satellite internet is important for dealing with disasters and security situations. It provides reliable communication during natural disasters when normal internet connections may be down. 
                         
                        
                        Global cooperation: Satellite internet provides the opportunity for simple and global communication. This helps science, diplomacy and trade across borders. 
                         
                        Slower Internet: The network can become slower, as it can take time to get information, because they have to travel to space and back, and that travel time can take time, which means that the Internet can become slower. 
                         
                        
                        Conclusion: We believe that internet satellite can make society better, because of the positive acceptances that we have discussed. </p>
                    <li>Identify potential consequences</li>
                        <p>The establishment of the internet via satellites could lead to a reduction in the impact on nature. If a new large internet cable is to be laid, 
                            they could lead to encroachment on nature, internet via satellites avoids this. To protect the cables, they are often buried on the seabed. 
                            This can disturb the nearby ecosystem in a negative way

                        According to Howell and Pultarova <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-satellites.html">(Tereza Pultarova, 2023)</a>,
                        there are astronomers who are concerned that the shiny Starlink 
                        satellites could interfere with observing space. They also claim that the satellites can pose a collision hazard for spacecraft.

                                <p>  
                                    Space Debris: Launching more satellites could contribute to an increase in space debris, which could pose a risk to other satellites and space activities.

                                <li>Who might loose from this technology? </li>
                                    <p>Traditional Internet Service Providers: Satellite internet can pose a threat to traditional Internet Service Providers (ISPs), especially in remote and underserved areas. 
                                        Cable and Fiber Companies: In regions where satellite internet competes effectively, cable and fiber optic providers may experience a reduction in market share. 
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    
                                <li>Who might benefit from this technology? </li>
                                   <p>
                                    Rural and Remote Communities: Satellite internet can provide high-speed connectivity to areas where traditional broadband infrastructure is not practical or available. 
                                    
                                </p> 
                                    
                                <li>Are there environmental consequences? </li>
                                    <p>                                    
                                        Yes. Satellite internet infrastructure requires large amounts of energy for satellite operations and data centers, which can increase energy consumption and associated environmental impacts. 
                                    </p>

                                        The widespread use of satellite internet may raise concerns about user privacy and potential surveillance, depending on the policies and regulations in place. 
                                    </p>

                                        Satellite internet can bring competition to the Internet Service Providers market, lower prices and improve service quality
